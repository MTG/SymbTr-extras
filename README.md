If you want to install the package, it is recommended to install it and all the dependencies into a virtualenv. In the terminal, do the following:

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    python setup.py install

If you want to be able to edit files and have the changes be reflected, then
install the repository like this instead:

    pip install -e .

Now you can install the rest of the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements
